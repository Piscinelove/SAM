Neutron Solar System Pack provides you with the assets that can help you to quickly make a simple solar system model, or other space scene.


This pack includes:

- The textures of the Sun, 8 planets, 2 dwarf planet(Pluto and Ceres), and 8 moons(Moon, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Titan, Triton, Charon). Some less detailed surface textures (giant planet) are 1024x512, while most of the others are 2048x1024, the earth and the moon 4096x2048. The orginal textures of Pluto, Charon and Triton have black and unexplored regions, imaginary regions added on them.

- Simple Earth and Planet shader.

- A simple scene (object size to scale, distance not to scale).


The scenes are mainly intended for Windows, but they can run on other platforms. You need to implement your own controls for moblie devices.
